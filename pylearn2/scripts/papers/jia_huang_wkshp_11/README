This directory contains scripts for reproducing an experiment from
"Beyond Spatial Pyramids: Receptive Field Learning For Pooled Image Features"
by Yangqing Jia and Chang Huang
presented at the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning

In this experiment, we train a k-means dictionary of 1600 centroids on patches of the
CIFAR-100 dataset. We then extract features using the triangle code and the random
pooling procedure described in the paper. The authors obtained a test set accuracy
of 54.5 % using these features in an SVM.


Here is the procedure for reproducing this experiment:

1. Make sure you have a preprocessed version of 8x8 patches from the CIFAR-100 image
   dataset. If you have not run it already, run
   pylearn2/scripts/datasets/make_cifar100_patches_8x8.py
   DO NOT RUN THIS IF THE PREPROCESSED DATA ALREADY EXISTS!!!
   Different versions of scipy, different machines, different theano flags, etc. will
   all result in learning a slightly different preprocessor matrix, so if you overwrite
   the existing data with a new copy you will ruin everyone in the lab's experiments!!!!
   However, if you do not have a
   ${PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH}/cifar100/cifar100_patches_8x8/
   directory you must run this script.

2. Train your k-means dictionary by running

train.py kmeans.yaml
