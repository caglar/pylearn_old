Welcome
=======

Pylearn2 is still in heavy development. Don't expect a clean road without bump!

Pylearn2 is a machine learning library build on top of Theano.

Pylearn2 Vision
===============

* We build the parts when we need them.
* A machine learning toolbox for easy scientific experimentation
* Pylearn2 should contain all relevent models/algorithms published by the lab.
* Can reuse scikit.learn algo when pertinant
* Published models can support the scikit.learn interface
* Dataset interface for vector, images, video, ...
* Small framework for all what is needed for one normal MLP/RBM/SDA/Convolution experiments.
* Easy reuse of sub-component of Pylearn2.
   * You don't need to invest in the entire stack in order to use parts of it.
* Support cross-platform serialization of learned models.

But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom
(IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

Download
========

No PyPI download how. You must checkout the version in github for bleeding-edge/development version, available via:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn.git


There is dependency on Theano and the `old Pylearn <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn/>`_ project. You should also install them


Documentation
=============

Roughly in order of what you'll want to check out:

* :ref:`introduction` -- What is Pylearn2?
* :ref:`tutorial` -- Learn the basics.

Check out how Theano can be used for Machine Learning: `Deep Learning Tutorials <http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial>`_.

Community
=========

* Register and post to `pylearn-dev`_ if you want to talk to the developers.

* Register to `pylearn2-github`_ if you want to receive an email for all changes to the GitHub repository.

* Register to `theano-buildbot`_ if you want to receive our daily
  buildbot email. This is the buildbot for Pylearn2, Theano, Pylearn
  and the Deep Learning Tutorial.

* Ask/view questions/answers at `metaoptimize/qa/tags/theano`_ (it's like stack overflow for machine learning)

* We use the `github issues <https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn/issues>`_ to stay organized.

* Come visit us in Montreal!  Most of the developers are students in the LISA_ group at the `University of Montreal`_.
